there is a problem when app largly scale (more then 9,007,199,254,740,991 users since js store Number in 64 bit)
any ways if app ever scale past that number just replace the parseInt functions with BigInt since 
he has no predefined maximum limit

why i did not do it just because working with Number type is better

middleware can be updated

packages conflict

env 

the apis them selves
